        <h2>36 QUESTIONS TO FALL IN LOVE</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
Is it possible for two people to fall in love by asking each other a series of structured questions?  That's the idea behind the successful "36 questions that lead to love" experiment, which was made famous by a viral essay and was based on actual psychoanalytic theory on how romance develops. 36 questions to fall in love is a research, conducted at Stony Brook University in New York in 1997 by psychologist Dr. Arthur Aron, which measures rapid intimacy between two strangers. Dr. Aron administered the test by getting a heterosexual man and woman together and giving them a list of 36 questions to answer, followed by four minutes of intense eye contact. </p>

        <p class="paragraph">The goal of the research is to test the social psychology of relationships and to establish a sense of closeness, though Dr. Aron claims that the feeling can only last for a short time. So, while you shouldn't plan to fall in love right away after the 36th question is addressed, you will feel a spark.
The 36 questions are crucial in revealing the vulnerability and genuineness that many people find difficult to show in general, let alone when looking for love. “Psychological intimacy is a condition for passion,” says Dr. Davies. " The questions help us see that we're all human, which is incredibly bonding. It's the polar opposite of alienation, in which we believe everyone is smarter than us or that we're one up or one down. That, I believe, is critical in assisting with intimacy.”
</p>
        <p class="paragraph">The questions are intended to help two people progressively reveal more and more about themselves, as well as recognize ways in which they are alike and express what they like about each other. It's been discovered that a mixture of self-disclosure, perceived similarity, and being receptive to becoming close to each other speeds up the development of feelings of closeness and intimacy. The questions have been used in a variety of other psychological experiments, ranging from assisting married partners in being closer to one another to assisting individuals in reducing racial discrimination. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">The 36 questions have aided at least some couples in falling in love, but they haven't worked for everybody. Catron, the author of the viral New York Times article, later married the man with whom she conducted the experiment. Another couple from one of the Arons' initial question set studies married, and the entire research team was in attendance.
