        <h2>3D PRINTING</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">What is 3D Printing?</p>

        <p class="paragraph">3D printing uses computer-aided design (CAD) to create three-dimensional objects through a layering method. Sometimes referred to as additive manufacturing, 3D printing involves layering materials, like plastics, composites or bio-materials to create objects that range in shape, size, rigidity and color. It uses similar methods to a traditional inkjet printer with the help of powder-like materials and precision tools to create a three-dimensional object from scratch.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">3D printers can be used in almost all industries. They can be used for rapid prototyping, making healthcare products, etc. The first step of a 3D printing process is making a virtual 3D model using a CAD software. These models need to be extremely intricate. The model is then sliced into different layers, telling the printer to create internal lattices and columns that shape and strengthen the object. The next step is for the printer to start its job. It essentially adds hundreds or thousands of 2D prints on top of one another to make a three-dimensional object. To create the object, printers make use of a variety of materials such as:</p>
        <p class="paragraph">-Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) - the same material that LEGOs are made of</p>
        <p class="paragraph">-Carbon Fiber Filaments - used to create light-weight but strong objects</p>
        <p class="paragraph">-Metal Filament - finely ground metals and a polymer glue. They can come in steel, brass, bronze and copper in order to get the true look and feel of a metal object.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">The printing process can take between a few hours for simple objects like boxes or balls, to a few weeks for larger and more detailed projects. 3D printers can be as cheap as $200. Industrial 3D printers would usually cost much more ($100,000).</p>
        <p class="paragraph">
3D printing has some really interesting applications. It can be used to print houses, food (completely safe as long as the printer is clean), aerospace technology, organs and prosthetic limbs.
</p>
        <p class="paragraph">3D printing is in fact a better way to create prosthesis compared to traditional prosthesis that are not necessarily adapted to the patient. They can also be used to print bones. Printing organs (bioprinting) uses bio-inks, a material allowing the adhesion and proliferation of living cells. Maturation is part of the process for bioprinting, because cells have to grow and proliferate, this canâ€™t be done instantly. Bio-inks are hydrogel biomaterials, providing support to the cell while they produce their own natural extracellular matrix. The first 3D printed heart with human tissue has been developed recently. Although it is not perfect, it is the beginning of a medical revolution. </p>
