        <h2>APRAXIA, AGNOSIA, APHASIA</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
The Cerebral Cortex is the largest site of neural integration in the central nervous system. It plays a key role in attention, perception, awareness, thought, memory, language, and consciousness. Here we’ll talk about a few interesting disorders caused by damage to the cerebral cortex. This damage can be caused by tumors, accidents, etc. </p>

        <p class="paragraph">Apraxia is a motor disorder. People who have it find it difficult or impossible to make motor movements. Apraxia can be of different types such as orofacial apraxia, where the person is unable to voluntarily perform movements including facial muscles such as wink or smile. Another form of Apraxia affects the person’s ability to intentionally move their arms and legs. Even though they may be able to move their body parts, they may not be able to coordinate basic actions, such as drink a cup of water. Apraxia of speech makes it hard for the person to move their lips and tongue when desired, making it hard to physically form words. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">Agnosia is a disorder of perception. Some people call it Psychic Blindness. People who suffer from Agnosia are not blind, but they are unable to recognize what they see. If they are show a picture of an object, they can describe the features of that object but they cannot recognize the object itself. This is called visual Agnosia. Another form of Agnosia is when they can’t recognize faces. This is called Prosopagnosia or Face Blindness. So a person who has Prosopagnosia is unable to distinguish between different faces. They may not even be able to distinguish between a face and an apple. Their ability of self-recognition can also be impaired. Another visual disorder is Sensory Neglect or Hemispatial Neglect which results in entirely blocking out one side of the world. For example, if a person who suffers from Sensory Neglect is asked to draw a clock, they would put all the numbers (1 to 12) only on the right half of the clock. This indicates that they don’t even think of the left half of the world. </p>

        <p class="paragraph">Lastly, let’s talk about Aphasia. Aphasia is the impairment of language, affecting the production and comprehension of speech and the ability to read and write. There are many types of Aphasia as well. Receptive Aphasia allows you to speak, but what you say won’t make much sense and you will not be able to understand others easily. People that suffer from Broca’s Aphasia have partially lost the ability to produce language. An example of this type of Aphasia is ‘Hodor’ from ‘Game of Thrones’, who can only say the word ‘Hodor’ and nothing else. </p>
