        <h2>The 'Big O'</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
Sex may be passionate, intimate, exciting, joyful, and even beneficial exercise.
It can also be tedious, uncomfortable, unpleasant, or make you wonder why you bothered. An orgasm is a state of extreme pleasure that occurs as a result of sexual tension and excitement. It is not just produced by acute sexual stimulation, but it can also occur during any type of sexual activity, from foreplay to sexual intercourse. Orgasms are involuntary nervous system-controlled activities in which a man or woman experiences muscular spasms in different parts of the body. When this is achieved, the person will have a soothing experience as a result of the release of neurohormones oxytocin and prolactin, as well as endorphins.
</p>

        <p class="paragraph">The whole process for men involves 3-10 seconds of intense pleasure followed by a refractory period where another orgasm cannot be achieved. On the other hand, women do not experience a refractory period enabling them to experience multiple, consecutive orgasms. These last for an average of 20seconds and sometimes longer. While there are some physiological distinctions between male and female orgasms, studies  have proven that in the brain, an orgasm is an orgasm irrespective of sex.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">But it is the brain that takes the control of the whole process of orgasm, using functional MRI scans, studies indicate that there is brain activity in over 30 discreet regions, it is flooded with anticipatory and feel-good chemical, dopamine, which makes you crave the feeling again. this is in tandem with the release of oxytocin- an hormone that mediates bonding and love between mates. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">PET scans show that the brain activity between men and women during an orgasm is the same. In both genders, the lateral orbitofrontal cortex is turned off, which controls self-evaluation, reason and control. This shuts down fear and anxiety, which is seen as the most essential aspect leading up to an orgasm. The relaxation of the amygdala and the hippocampus in women, further reduces emotions producing a trance-like state, while in men, it dampens aggressiveness. Many parts in the women’s brain is shut off during an orgasm, but these effects are less striking in men, likely because of the shorter duration and difficulty with measuring during the brain scan. In women, an area called the periaqueductal gray is activated, stimulating the flight or fight response, while the cortex which is associated with pain lights up. Following this climax and muscle contraction, the body experiences deep relaxation and the heart rate slows to a resting phase. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">Although media portrayals of orgasm, partners' expectations for our orgasms, and our own interest in experiencing orgasm can make us feel as if we need to have an orgasm every time we have sex, having a good sex life does not always imply having a mind-blowing orgasm during every sexual session. Many individuals claim that not all orgasms are the same, which makes sense because our minds and bodies change from day to day (due to mood, health, stress levels, and so on), so expecting any sort of stimulation to elicit the same experience every time is unrealistic. Orgasm is merely one of numerous important characteristics of sexual satisfaction. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">•	XXY – Roughly 1 in 500 to 1 in 1,000 people (Klinefelter)</p>
        <p class="paragraph">•	XYY – Roughly 1 out of 1,000 people</p>
        <p class="paragraph">•	XXXY – Roughly 1 in 18,000 to 1 in 50,000 births</p>
 <p class="paragraph">Nowadays, the difference between the meaning of biological sex and gender has been misunderstood. Biological sex is determined by the karyotype the individual possesses. The physiology and the brain, reproductive system and body, resembles that of the opposite sex , like in the case of a transgender. Whereas gender is mostly associated with cultural behaviour: the way a person dresses, manner, signs of deference.
“you can be a woman with a penis”, “woman” refers to gender and not the biological sex This vocabulary gap is responsible for nearly all disputes between groups on issues concerning this area.
