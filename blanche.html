        <h2>A Streetcar Named Desire</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
            INTRODUCTION </p>
         <p class="paragraph">A fading southern belle, Blanche DuBois is losing her grip on reality. As the play progresses,
Blanche becomes increasingly detached. Having lost her family fortune, she suffers from an
alcohol problem and a damaged reputation. Her alcohol problem can be interpreted as a
coping mechanism for the stresses in her life, some of which are self-induced. Blanche has a
snobbish public persona that is her way of hiding her financial situation and tarnished
reputation. Privately, she is insecure and vulnerable. This contradictory nature is explored
through the use of multiple literary devices, some of which are explored at a greater length
below. This essay will thus explore the creativity with which Tennessee Williams uses
dramatic and linguistic techniques to portray the contradictory identity of Blanche in the
play ‘A Streetcar Named Desire’. The essay will be divided into three parts, each
representing a separate device. It aims to explore the use of these devices and their
             subsequent influence on Blanche’s contradictory nature. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">NARRATIVE</p>
          <p class="paragraph">In the opening scene of the play, the audience is introduced to Blanche, a ‘daintily dressed’
woman who carried a ‘delicate beauty’. As she sneaks a drink, her alcoholism is revealed to
the audience. After helping herself to a tumbler of whiskey that she has qualms about,
Tennessee Williams shows the audience at the very onset that she is heavily driven by
desire. At this point in the play, it is evident that Blanche is a social pariah. She is a widow
who has lost her family fortune and estate. As the rising action of the play unfurls, the
              multiple strata of Blanche’s character are revealed.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">During a game of poker at their house, the audience is introduced to Stanley’s friend Mitch,
who becomes a potential love interest to Blanche. During their first interaction alone,
Blanche selectively opens up about her past and reveals her trauma to Mitch. She is
voluntarily vulnerable for the first time and it is clear at this instance that Blanche uses
flirtation as a coping mechanism as she believes that in order to live a stable and secure life
again, she needs a man. After having overheard a conversation between Stella and Blanche
where Blanche tries to talk stella into leaving Stanley, Stanley is angered and tells the details
of Blanche’s sordid past to Mitch. The details of her affair with a student are revealed to the
audience. At this instance, her self-destructive tendencies are revealed to the audience.
During her final visit with Mitch, these tendencies catch up to her. It is because of her past
              indulgences that Mitch deems her an unfit partner.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">In the climax of the play, Blanche is raped by Stanley. At this instance, Blanche’s character is
revealed for who she is; a helpless, fading southern belle who heavily relies on men for
stability and validation. Towards the resolution, Blanche is sent to a mental hospital, taken
              away by a doctor while she patiently waited for her date to arrive.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">IMAGERY</p>
          <p class="paragraph">Throughout the play, Tennessee Williams uses imagery to depict conflicts, motives and
themes. Light and dark imagery is used extensively to portray Blanche’s character and the
assimilation of her many layers. Auditory imagery is used to emphasize significant events in
the play. This section of the essay will explore the use of imagery in the portrayal of
              Blanche’s contradictory identities and their assimilation with each other.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Light and dark imagery:</p>
          <p class="paragraph">At the very onset of the play, an exchange between Blanche and Stella reveals Blanche’s
contempt for harsh light. Following this, blanche is rarely seen in severe lighting. Her disdain
for it stems from her desire to conceal her true self and age to potential suitors. She only
prefers to see Mitch in the dark or after dusk. She does so as her fantasy of being a beautiful
young debutante makes her want to hide her fading beauty from herself and others. when
the reality of her past is exposed, mitch insists on seeing her in direct light. The use of direct
light emphasizes Blanche’s vulnerability in the moment. She is completely out of control and
helpless. Figuratively, the Blanche known to the audience under dim lights is vastly
              contradictory to her own personality; hence the use of harsh lights when she is exposed.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Auditory imagery:</p>
          <p class="paragraph">Tennessee Williams distinctively uses auditory imagery in combination with important
events that highlight Blanche’s persona. The many musical motifs have their own roles and
purposes in the play. The Varsuviana polka for example was the music playing moments
before Blanche’s husband killed himself. She often hears the polka at instances when she
feels sorry about his death. The song ‘It’s Only a Paper Moon’ shows her descent into
insanity. The blue piano represents sadness and is often heard during mournful moments in
the play, for example when blanche breaks the news of the loss of Belle Reve to Stella. Its
music intensifies until it is overshadowed by the sound of a passing trail as Stanley is about
              rape Blanche, where she seems completely helpless and sheds her snobbish public persona.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">STAGE DIRECTION</p>
          <p class="paragraph">Tennessee Williams is often acknowledged for the elaborate stage directions he includes in
his plays, often adding to their already refined details. The stage directions in a streetcar
named desire effect all aspects of the story, especially its characterisation. It often
symbolises a character’s emotions and shows the physical and emotional perspectives of the
              characters.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Blanche DuBois’s mental health problems are displayed in part by her actions but to the
audience, it is most discernible by the tone of her voice and her motions. There is an
absolute lack of privacy in the house, often making Blanche feel overwhelmed by the
presence of people around her, especially Stanley. In the opening scene, blanche is
described as ‘daintily dressed’ and having a ‘delicate beauty’. To the audience, Blanche
seems like a tasteful and refined woman. Here, the audience are introduced to her persona.
Towards the end of the play however, stage directions depict Blanche as an unstable,
delusional woman as she ‘murmurs excitedly as if to a group of spectral admirers’ and

describe her turning around ‘weakly’ and hesitantly’. Towards the end of the play, the
audience is well aware of both; Blanche’s mental condition as well as her façade. the identity
that she so carefully tries to hide is a reality everyone can see, especially after Stanley rapes
            her.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">CONCLUSION</p>
        <p class="paragraph">In conclusion, Tennessee Williams uses multiple literary devices, each in their own unique
ways to depict the duality within Blanche’s character as the play progresses. While the plot
progression slowly reveals Blanche’s true nature, imagery and stage direction depict her
mental state at one instance. Upon studying the progression in imagery and stage direction,
Blanche’s loosening grip on reality is revealed. The themes of the play are relevant to the
time period as America saw a shift from the estate holders and ‘old money’ to an increase in
the working class. In a more modern context however, the play talks about rape,
homosexuality, mental health, domestic violence, and many other issues that are extremely
            relevant to movements and social causes that are heavily talked about today.</p>
