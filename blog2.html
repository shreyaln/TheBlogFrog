        <h2>SCIENCE OF HEARTBREAK</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">Heartbreak is a tragically normal aspect of the human experience, and it stinks. We've all been there, and it's fair to say that none of us want to go through it again.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">We are heartbroken when we miss someone or something we care deeply for, such as a loving relationship or a friendship, a family member, a pet, or a career or opportunity.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Although there is still much to learn on how and when we experience love and heartbreak, as well as the impact they have on our bodies, clinical science has provided us with some clues on why heartbreak makes you feel terrible, as well as some techniques to try if you're feeling particularly down.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">According to research, the brain detects emotional suffering of heartbreak in the same way as it registers physical pain, which is why you may believe your heartbreak is causing physical pain. According to a study conducted by Kross E, et al. in 2011, people's brain function was comparable when they saw a snapshot of a former love and when they burnt their arm- the anterior cingulate cortex is stimulated.  Hormones aren't just for rambunctious teenagers; our bodies generate a slew of hormones on a regular basis for a number of reasons, like falling in and out of love. love can be addictive, the hormones released by our brain as we get too addicted to someone or something, , just like a drug. Dopamine and oxytocin, in particular, are hormones that make us feel great and want to replicate behaviors, and they are produced in high amounts while we are in love.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">When a person experiences heartbreak, these hormone levels fall and are replaced by the stress hormone cortisol. This can be seen in the study of primates, which show an increase in cortisol and a decline in norepinephrine when separated from loved ones, resulting in a significant stress response eventually contributing to anxiety, depression and loud crying. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">Acute emotional discomfort, whether positive or negative, can cause the left ventricle of the heart to â€˜stun' or paralyze, resulting in heart attack-like symptoms such as severe chest, hip, or shoulder pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, lack of consciousness, nausea, and vomiting.The good news is that, unlike a heart attack, the disease rarely causes permanent damage and mostly recovers on its own. The bad news is that it can be exhausting and uncomfortable, with patients often believing they are having a heart attack.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Low levels of discomfort are associated with high levels of social care. So, if you're heartbroken, surround yourself with friends and relatives. Remember that the old adage "you'll recover with time" has some merit to it. As the tension subsides and you continue to relax and heal, your bodily processes can eventually return to normal.
