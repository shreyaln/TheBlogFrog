        <h2>THE “COUCH POTATO” GENE</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">Who doesn't like a relaxing day of doing nothing? We've all had those days, whether it is avoiding work or missing physical exercise, but why are some people way more lazy than others? Is there a gene for being a couch potato that triggers this counterproductive behavior?</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Our brain has evolved to respond positively to food, sex, and exercise. when we perform these actions, we get a sense of satisfaction and pleasure-from the release of dopamine that conveys the message throughout our body – ultimately ensuring the survival of our species. The pleasure derived from exercise is just as addictive as that experienced from food and sex.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Experiments on rats have shown that laziness could be a genetic trait. A team of scientists placed rats in cages with running wheels and tracked how much time they spent running over the course of six days. The top 26 runners were then bred together, and the 26 laziest rats were paired up. After repeating this selective breeding process for ten generations, the disparity was obvious in their offspring: the running mice would run on wheels 75 percent more than the other race, and by 16 generations, they were running 7 miles a day instead of the average 4 miles. Their desire to engage in physical activity seemed to be genetic. We inherit genes from our parents, some genes literally make us crave action. Running mice's brains were found to have a larger dopamine system as well as motivation and reward-related areas. they needed the physical activity otherwise their brains would act like a drug addictive rodent when deprived of cocaine or LSD. they were genetically addicted to running! </p>
        <p class="paragraph">Other traits such as procrastination, impulsivity, work ethic, and straight up laziness are also inherited genes. It turns out that we have a "couch potato gene" that causes us to be physically lazy or a mutation in a normal gene that controls activity levels. This gene is responsible for a form of dopamine receptor, and if you don't have it, you're more likely to enjoy lounging around doing less than people who possess the properly functioning gene.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">So, it's possible that your urge to participate in an activity isn't entirely your own. Nonetheless, a variety of environmental factors play a part, which means you are not doomed to a life of laziness. So, if you believe you are genetically lazy, get off the couch and battle your DNA. </p>
