        <h2>MARIJUANA AS MEDICINE?</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
Marijuana refers to the dried buds and leaves of Cannabis sativa plant varieties that can grow in warm and tropical climates around the world, and cultivated for commercial purposes. For centuries, marijuana has been used for herbal remedies. Cannabinoids, which are biologically active components of marijuana, have been identified by scientists. The chemicals delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol are the two most studied components (CBD). Other cannabinoids are being researched as well. Marijuana is most commonly consumed orally (edible marijuana) or smoking or vaping it (inhaled marijuana):</p>
        <p class="paragraph">•	Edible marijuana: When THC is consumed by mouth- candy, baked items, drinks, and cooking oil, it is it is poorly absorbed and can take hours to react. After it's consumed, the liver processes it, producing a second psychoactive agent (a drug that acts on the brain and alters mood or consciousness) that has a different effect on the brain than THC.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">•	Inhaled marijuana: THC reaches the bloodstream and rapidly travels to the brain when marijuana is smoked or vaporized. Since the second psychoactive compound is generated in small quantities, it has a lesser impact. Marijuana inhaled has a shorter duration of effect than marijuana consumed orally.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">A handful of studies have shown that smoking marijuana can help with nausea and vomiting caused by cancer chemotherapy. Inhaled (smoked or vaporized) marijuana has been shown to be effective in the treatment of neuropathic pain (pain caused by damaged nerves). There have been no human research on the effects of marijuana or hemp oil. People who took marijuana extracts in clinical trials needed less pain medication, according to studies. THC and other cannabinoids, such as CBD, have recently been discovered to slow the growth and/or cause death in cancer cells developing in lab dishes. Although research has shown that cannabinoids are safe in the treatment of cancer, there is no evidence that they help stabilize or cure the disease.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">While THC can help with nausea and appetite, it can also cause problems with thinking and concentration, and in the long run, it can lead to psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia, depression, and bipolar disorder. THC can also cause respiratory problems such as chronic bronchitis as a side effect. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">Marijuana's classification as an illicit drug has severely restricted research into its medicinal applications. Over the last few decades, however, there has been a surge of interest in this area. More research is required to fully comprehend the promising possible benefits of improving cancer patients' symptoms and quality of life.</p>
