        <h2>YOUR BRAIN ON LSD</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
            LSD is one of the most powerful mood-altering chemicals available. It's made from lysergic acid, which grows on rye and other grains and is produced by the ergot fungus. It's made in illegal labs, often in the United States, in crystal form. For distribution, the crystals are transformed into a liquid. It has a slightly bitter taste and is odorless and colorless.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">The effects of LSD on the human brain have been revealed for the first time in history using cutting-edge brain imaging technology. Imperial College London researchers used brain scanning and other techniques to demonstrate what happens when someone takes the powerful (and illegal) psychedelic Lysergic acid diethylamide. During a hallucinogenic state, images of the brain revealed almost the entire organ lit up with activity."We see this explosion of contact," said the study's lead author, Dr Robin Carhart-Harris of Imperial College's Department of Medicine. The visual cortex became much more involved in relation to the rest of the brain, and blood flow to visual regions increased as well, which the researchers suggest is linked to the hallucinations experienced by volunteers.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">LSD was first developed in Switzerland in 1938 for the treatment of psychological conditions, but its subsequent success as a recreational psychedelic led to its criminalization in many countries around the world.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">The results, which were published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) in April 2016, show how the drug reduces contact between the brain regions that make up the Default Mode Network (DMN), which is a series of hub centers that function together to monitor and repress consciousness. The DMN is the neural correlate of the ego, and it regulates the amount of sensory input that reaches our field of consciousness. The extent of this effect is directly related to the intensity of the subjective experience of "ego-dissolution" and a sense of oneness and unity, according to the findings. This may have enormous implications for LSD-assisted psychotherapy, as it shows how the drug helps patients to break free from the static modes of perception and thinking that are at the root of difficult-to-treat disorders like depression and addiction. </p>
