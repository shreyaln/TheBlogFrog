        <h2>Society Decides Who Can and Can't Have body hair?</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
Please answer this question of mine - who decides who CAN and CANNOT have body hair? Who gave
society the power to decide on which gender, body hair is okay? It’s just hair! Visible body hair is
rarely seen. It is so rare that visible underarm hair on a celebrity becomes ‘the most trendy gossip’.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">For the rest of us, showing up with an unshaved leg or arm is almost a political statement in itself.
Quite simply, body hair is not a feature of the ideal body. It's not just that the ideal body should be
hairless, it's more like everybody has to be hairless everyday. Body hair bothers people so much that
it’s the only thing that stands out and is deemed abnormal and unnatural. Its not just that we are
setting impossible beauty standards to attain, it's more of making people believe in false normalcy.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Society expects that we make life hard so that they can have an alluring view. How sickening
is that?! It's almost like they are trying to state that people have nothing better to do other than
making themselves ‘presentable’ for the sake of others . It's absolutely nauseating that we have put
in that extra effort to create this false belief of normalcy. The irony is that the hair on our head
should be profuse and luscious, meanwhile if it is on any other part of our body it needs to banished.
As the hairless body becomes the only acceptable body, a dramatic shift happens. Even though it is
so demanding, we are not questioning this absurd expectation. We have normalized this. Those who
choose to break these norms and show their body hair are considered bold, brave and confident;
when all they’re trying to do is live their life with a little bit of comfort.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">These days girls who
show their underarm hair are making headlines, that’s how low the society has stooped. Worrying about meaningless standards such as this, we forget to enjoy life and do our own thing. I’m
pretty sure that this is not the purpose of our life. Let's just use the time we’re wasting to shear out
our hair in actually pampering ourselves and doing things that give US satisfaction . Remember,
the point is to please ourselves, not others.</p>
