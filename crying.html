        <h2>TEARS ARE NOT A SIGN OF WEAKNESS</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
Contrary to common belief, crying is not bad for you. It’s just how the world has been programmed since the beginning of time - tears are a sign of weakness.
</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Tears are produced by lacrimal glands located above the eyes. They spread across the surface of the eye when you blink. They drain into small holes in the corners of your upper and lower eye-lids before travelling through small channels and down your tear ducts (nasolacrimal ducts) to your nose. These tears mix with the mucus in your nose and hence your nose waters when you cry.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">There are three types of tears: basal, reflex and emotional tears. The first 2 types of tears remove debris such as smoke and dust from our eyes, and lubricate our eyes to help protect them from infection. They are 98% water.  Emotional tears, on the other hand, flush stress hormones and other toxins out of our system. These tears potentially offer the most health benefits out of the three. Crying releases oxytocin and endogenous opioids (endorphins - pain-relievers). These feel-good chemicals help ease both physical and emotional pain. Humans are the only animals capable of producing emotional tears. Other animals do have the ability to produce tears, but only for lubricating their eyes or removing debris.
</p>
        <p class="paragraph">There are a few possible reasons why women on an average cry more than men do (apart from social stigma of course). Men have larger tear ducts than women, and so it is likely that in a woman’s eye, the tears would well up and spill onto the cheek quicker than for men. Hormones play a role in this too, obviously. It is believed that testosterone inhibits crying. For example, male prostate cancer patients tend to become more emotional when treated with medication to lower their testosterone levels. Among other things, tears contain prolactin - a hormone which is present 60% more in women than in men.
</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Researchers note that, on average, American women cry 3.5 times each month, while American men cry about 1.9 times each month. If tears start rolling out more frequently and/or for no apparent reason, affect daily activities and become uncontrollable, it may be time to approach a medical professional. There are many abnormalities associated with crying. People suffering from certain kinds of clinical depression may not be able to cry even when they feel like it. Uncontrollable tears can be caused by a condition called Pseudobulbar affect(PBA). It’s characterized by episodes of sudden uncontrollable crying or laughing. The laughter usually turns to tears.
</p>
        <p class="paragraph">One thing to take away from this would be to understand that crying is a way to relieve pain, get rid of tension, and even express happiness; but it is not a sign of weakness. </p>
