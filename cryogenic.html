        <h2>CRYOGENIC SLEEP </h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
 Cryogenic sleep or suspended animation means exactly what it sounds like. It is a deep sleep at extremely low temperatures. The body enters into a hibernation-like state where the metabolism is reduced to its lowest possible level, keeping only the vital functions intact.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Cryogenic freezing is already being used on a large scale. For example, this concept is used in the aeronautics industry to produce fuels for rockets and the food and health industry to ensure that food stays fresh, perhaps over long sea travel.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">There are hundreds of cryogenically frozen people in the world. Soon after their passing, they have been stored at low temperatures in hopes that they can live again when future technology enables them to be reanimated. The concept sounds pretty simple doesn’t it – but it most definitely is not. The principle behind the preservation of bodies is called vitrification – a procedure intended to keep our cells from crystallizing. During the initial stage of this process, the recently deceased person undergoes a thoracotomy and all of their blood is drained out and substituted with medical grade antifreeze. Then, this person is immersed in a liquid nitrogen tank at -380°F.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">But here’s the important question – how will these cryogenically frozen people be resuscitated? The answer to this question is unknown and that is terrifying. Scientists and doctors have made progress in finding the answer to this question such as regeneration of tissues and growing organs. Revival of the frozen humans will not just require regeneration of tissues but also healing whatever illness or condition contributed to their death.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Cryogenic sleep has the potential to enable astronauts to undertake journeys that would otherwise not be manageable by the human body. Another application of cryogenic sleep would be to preserve bodies until medicine finds a cure for their illness. So what is preventing us from changing theory to reality? Ethically and medically, trials on healthy humans are way off. Present day technology and knowledge is not sufficiently advanced in order to undertake such a task. But research suggests that cryogenic sleep will definitely be possible in the near future. </p>
