        <h2>DESIGNER BABIES</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
The banana did not always look like what it does at present. For many years, humans have used Genetic Engineering to modify living-beings to suit their needs. We’ve created plants that fight pollution, faster-growing trees (for our ever growing demand for wood), and onions that don’t make you cry. Animals too have been modified. Today there are super muscled pigs, featherless chickens, see-through frogs and glow-in-the-dark fish.

</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Genetic engineering is the direct manipulation of an organism’s genes using biotechnology. Earlier in this journey, the cost of genetic engineering was exorbitantly high, but this has changed with the introduction of CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats). Let’s first look at the beginning of CRISPR.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">When a bacteriophage attacks a bacterium and this bacterium manages to survive the attack, it can now activate its most effective antivirus system. It does so by storing a part of the virus DNA in its own genetic code in a DNA archive called CRISPR. Here, it is stored safely until it is needed. When the virus attacks again, the bacterium makes an RNA copy from the archive and arms a protein called CAS9. This protein scans the bacterium’s insides for signs of the virus invader by comparing every bit of DNA it finds to the sample from the archive. When it finds a 100% match, it is activated and cuts out the virus DNA. CAS9 is extremely precise. Scientists soon found that CRISPR was programmable. All they had to do was give CRISPR a copy of the DNA you want to modify and put the system into a living cell. Although CRISPR is cost-efficient, precise and works for every type of cell, it is still a first-generation tool.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Many genetic diseases are caused by a single incorrect letter in the DNA. CRISPR has led to breakthroughs in the process of curing HIV and Cancer. Our immune cells can be edited to make them better cancer hunters. Many genetic diseases are caused by a single incorrect letter in the DNA. In just a decade or two, thousands of diseases could be cured forever. One drawback is that these applications are limited to the individual and die with them, unless they are used on reproductive cells or early embryos. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">The next step in this revolution would be the creation of modified human beings. Although in its early stages, the means to edit the genome of a human embryo already exists. These changes will be passed on to the next generation because the embryo itself would be modified. Initially, this would be used to eliminate a deadly genetic disease. As this technology progresses, people may no longer be satisfied with a disease-free child. They may want to extend the modification to enhanced metabolism, extraordinary intelligence, perfect eyesight, etc. However, the ultimate achievement would be to eliminate ageing.</p>
