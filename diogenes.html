        <h2>Diogenes- The World’s First Hippie</h2>


        <p class="paragraph">‘He has the most who is most content with the least.’</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Diogenes, often referred to as ‘Diogenes the Cynic’, was a Greek philosopher
and one of the founders of Cynic philosophy. Diogenes lived in a barrel
without any worldly possessions and rejected societal norms. Diogenes felt
that by rejecting the opinions of society and it’s measures of success he could
truly be free. Diogenes would roam around Athens with a lantern in hopes of
finding an ‘honest man’. Diogenes didn’t consider himself as belonging to a
country but instead believed he was a ‘citizen of the world.’
</p>
        <p class="paragraph">While most people today would look at Diogenes as a lunatic, much of
his work laid the foundation for cynic philosophy. Diogenes is also
remembered for his quips and witty comebacks. Once when Diogenes
was laying in the Sun, Alexander approached him and asked Diogenes if
there was something he could do, to which Diogenes replied, ‘Stand out
of my light.’ Diogenes belongs to the rare breed of men who practice
what they preach. He truly believed in what he professed and is famous
for saying, ‘It is the privilege of the Gods to want nothing, and of
godlike men to want little.’
</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Whether or not you agree with Diogenes’ style of living there are
certainly some aspects of his life that we can learn from. He questioned
the status quo and that’s an example we can still follow. Not to blindly
follow conventional or majority views but to think hard about what is
truly valuable. Thinking critically of our institutions and way of life is
more important than ever.
