        <h2>EXERCISE ALLERGY</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
It’s real. About 2% of the entire population is allergic to exercise; a sweaty workout could kill them. This is a rare condition called exercise-induced anaphylaxis (EIA). Anaphylaxis is a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction due to exposure to an allergen, in this case - exercise. Symptoms of exercise-induced anaphylaxis include hives, fainting, vomiting and difficulty breathing during a workout, and can last up to four hours after. In some cases, it can be triggered by certain foods eaten before exercise, like peanuts, shellfish, eggs or even, in two reported cases, celery. But this isn't just your average food allergy.
</p>

        <p class="paragraph">During exercise, heart rate increases and blood starts whizzing through the organs much faster and more frequently than it normally does. With every trip the blood takes to the stomach, it’s picking up more of the food that may cause EIA - for example, peanut bits. For those with EIA, the normal amount of peanut antigens picked up by the blood isn’t enough to bother them (unlike for those with a regular peanut allergy). But while exercising, the extra peanut bits their blood picks up causes an allergic reaction.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">Running, dancing, football, etc are likely to trigger an attack. Management methods are similar to those used to treat regular anaphylaxis such as intramuscular epinephrine, antihistamine, systemic steroid, fluid resuscitation, and supportive care. There are also various preventive steps that can be taken such as avoiding food or medication that can trigger symptoms close to the time of exercise and avoiding exercise in hot, cold or humid weather. Although serious side-effects are rare, exercise-induced anaphylaxis often goes undiagnosed. So I’d suggest going to a doctor in case you feel itchy during a workout. It would be a shame if the cause of death was listed as ‘running on a treadmill’.
