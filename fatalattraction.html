        <h2>FATAL ATTRACTION HYPOTHESIS</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
Diane Felmlee (1995) created this highly dramatic and expressively worded theory, which provides insight into why relationships fail. In essence, this hypothesis states that what was formerly viewed as a benefit is now viewed as a cost: the same quality that initially drew you in eventually leads to the breakup of the relationship.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Felmlee employed the self-report method on 301 college students, asking them to write down the attributes that first drew them to a new partner, followed by a list of the qualities they disliked (meaning what initially attracted them to that person and then what drove them mad about that person as the relationship developed). Felmlee identified 88 (almost 30%) fatal attraction break-ups, which are described as relationships that begin on the basis of exciting or fascinating features and then end in the relationship's dissolution.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Three patterns that typify fatal attraction break-ups:</p>
        <p class="paragraph">1.	Fun to Foolish: The most common reason for relationship collapse was fun to foolishness, according to the findings. For example, a 'fun' and unpredictable individual who is the life and soul of the party, who jokes around and is always 'up' can subsequently appear immature, careless, and dumb.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">2.	Strong to domineering: the first appeal may be based on someone who has a reassuring presence and delivers strength, definite opinions, and confidence. These characteristics may be seen as autocratic, bossy, strong, or hectoring over time.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">3.	This is the type of person who would pick up karate on the spur of the moment or suggest, "Let's go to Paris this weekend!" They may attract others because they appear spontaneous and life-affirming. These characteristics may become annoying over time since they appear to reflect a lack of focus, instability, unpredictability, and consistency.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Simply put, people are drawn to those who are believed to be similar to them, even though dating people who are diametrically opposed to one might be thrilling. It is not impossible for two individuals who are very different to have a good relationship, but couples who stay together are more likely to have more in common than those who do not.</p>
