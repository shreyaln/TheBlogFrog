        <h2>Feminism is a Sham</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
If you ask anyone what is meant by feminism, they would say that it’s the ideology or movement which hopes to achieve equality among the different genders. But if you ask me, today’s feminist movement has gone too far. </p>

        <p class="paragraph">To further corroborate my title , lets look at the glaring similarities between fascism and feminism. Both prey on fear and making someone a patsy.  For example, if we see the Jian Ghomeshi case where the lawyer who defended the accused was a female, was accused and heckled for “betraying women”. It is so hypocritical that “feminists” fight for equal rights in certain jobs and at the same time badmouth and troll women who are good at that very job. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">Coming to the second allegation on making someone a patsy, we saw in Nazi Germany, the minority and oppressed Jews were a target and a common rallying point for Nazi Germans. In modern day feminism, we see that so called “oppressors” i.e., white men are targeted and made a patsy. Feminists frequently target white men and state that they are the cause for all their issues, just how Nazi Germans blamed the Jews. The only difference is that Nazi’s targeted the oppressed but the clever “feminists” have chosen their former oppressors. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">Thirdly, feminists believe that there must be 50:50 quota in the parliament or cabinet of ministers. If this is implemented, it would be disastrous to say the least as it would benefit only the under-qualified women and would punish qualified men for being MEN. At the same time qualified women would be questioned, trolled and mocked as people would be led to believe that these women got in because of the quota. thus, its clear that feminism is a Sham and has gone too far from its initial intention for universal suffrage. </p>
