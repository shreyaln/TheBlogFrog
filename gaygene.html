        <h2>THE GAY GENE</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
Two to six percent of people self-identify as having predominantly homosexual attractions and, while there are several social and political reasons why, what does science say?
Is being gay genetic, and if so do we all have a gay gene?
</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Two studies conducted in the nineties utilizing the human genome project discovered that gay men had a greater number of homosexual relatives than heterosexual men and that gay siblings had similar links on their X chromosome, indicating a high level of genetic inheritance. A more recent research of 409 gay siblings discovered links in a specific area of the X chromosome known as Xq28 and in another region of chromosome 8. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">Furthermore, a 2014 study of fifty years of research showed that gay men were more likely to have gay brothers than straight men, and lesbian women are more likely to have lesbian sisters, implying that the traits are genetically connected and passed down.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">But, if homosexuality is genetic, isn't this a paradox? </p>
        <p class="paragraph">While some gay people have children, they have 80% less children than heterosexuals, therefore wouldn't the genes not be passed down and eventually die out?</p>
        <p class="paragraph">A recent UCLA study used epigenetics to postulate that everyone has a gay gene, but the attachment of a methyl group to specific sections of DNA is what activates it. Epigenetics is the study of how your environment can chemically modify your genes. in the UCLA study, homosexual and heterosexual male twins participated. They discovered that a certain methylation pattern was closely related in terms of sexual orientation. The model was able to predict the sexuality of men with 70% accuracy, However, this data only included a limited fraction of participants, and there is some controversy around the research. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">Ultimately, no unique gay gene has been discovered, although scientific data suggests that
does not imply that human sexual orientation is strictly controlled at the molecular level and is tied to genetics. It has even been discovered that having a son increases the chances of the next son being homosexual by 33% as compared to the baseline population. There is no effect if an older brother is from a different mother. his has led some researchers to believe that male pregnancy triggers a biological mechanism that affects the mother's successive births.
</p>
        <p class="paragraph">A meta-analysis also found that statistically, homosexual men
have more older brothers than heterosexual men. Another study found that women exposed to high levels of testosterone in utero have higher rates of being not straight.
So, why does this happen? The gay uncle hypothesis suggests that gay members of a family that don't reproduce still increase the prevalence of their family's genes in future generations by helping to provide resources for offspring that they're related to.
</p>
 <p class="paragraph">After all, it's not just survival of the fittest individual, but the fittest family. Studies also show that there are lower levels of hostility and higher levels of emotional intelligence, compassion and cooperation in gay men, which may also increase altruism and survival in human groups. Another hypothesis suggests that genes from homosexuality are ultimately coding for attraction meaning female relatives of gay men who share the same gene will also have stronger attractions to men, providing an evolutionary advantage. And, studies have shown that these females have more babies on average. The same would be true of lesbians and their straight male relatives. The famous scientist E.O. Wilson once said</p>
<p class="paragraph">"Homosexuality gives advantages to the group. A society that condemns homosexuality condemns itself." Historically, science has not been kind to the queer community. In the past, it was generally accepted that the brains and bodies of homosexuals were presumed to be
of lower status, with a popular belief that homosexual behavior was a result of defective development. Even some LGBTQ people fear that scientific research could "other" the community and be used to exploit or hurt people. Even from the available research, it's clear that most studies only focus on gay men and neglect other groups.But more research on the genetic and epigenetic factors of homosexuality will decrease homophobic laws around the world by further proving that being gay is not a choice.
