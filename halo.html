        <h2>THE HALO EFFECT </h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
The halo effect is a cognitive bias that happens when a favourable initial impression of a person automatically affects one's overall image of that person. When making a first impression, seeing an initial favourable feature—such as beauty or strength—can make the individual appealing, making it difficult to change that opinion based on fresh or contradictory information. An attractive person, for example, may be seen as interesting, ambitious, or witty, whether or not this judgement is justified.
The mind searches the world for evidence to back up preconceived notions. People want to avoid the challenge of reconciling contradictory data and hope to be sure in their first conclusions. Human beings are complicated; the halo effect may be a useful tool for understanding another person till the relationship develops.
</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Edwin Thorndike, a psychologist, coined the phrase in 1920. Thorndike urged commanding officers to grade soldiers on physical traits like physique as well as behavioural traits like intelligence, leadership, and loyalty. He discovered that exceptional physical qualities and superior behavioural attributes have unusually substantial relationships.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">This effect affects your perception of a person or a product, leading you to believe that the person or product is better and more fantastic than truth suggests. We are more likely to overlook a beautiful person's flaws, such as selfishness, and rate them more favourably than is warranted.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">This is why we sometimes fail to see when someone is taking advantage of us or deceiving us. We create a judgement that we do not allow anything else overcome until it is too late because of the halo effect. Because we believe they are a wonderful person, we justify their terrible behaviour and wrongdoings. We make a decision and refuse to consider that a person may have changed or that we made a mistake. You refuse to extend the benefit of the doubt to the other person. You end up being so adamant about your point of view that you refuse to change it even when provided with facts to the contrary. This obfuscates your judgement and causes you to trust the wrong individuals at times. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">Even knowing about the halo effect makes it difficult to ignore its influence on our perceptions and decisions. The halo effect is one of many cognitive biases that allows people to make rapid decisions while also contributing to judgement errors. </p>
