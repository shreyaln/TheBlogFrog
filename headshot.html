        <h2>HEADSHOT</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
We live in a violent world, frequently experiencing disaster. Sadly, people get shot everyday. Let’s talk about what happens internally when you get shot in different parts of your body and what your chances of survival are.
</p>

        <p class="paragraph">The degree of tissue disruption caused by a projectile (bullet) is related to the cavitation it creates as it passes through tissue. As the bullet passes through tissue, crushing and lacerating, it creates an empty space (cavity) along its path. Higher-velocity bullets create a pressure wave that forces the surrounding tissues away, thereby creating a larger cavity than the caliber of the bullet itself.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">What happens when you’re shot in the head?</p>
        <p class="paragraph">The bullet goes through hair, skin and muscle before it smashes into one of the eight cranial bones engineered to keep your brain safe. While this happens, the projectile makes shrapnel of your calcium, phosphorus, sodium and collagen case. The connective tissue and fibrous membranes that act as internal cushioning are split open just before the bullet dives into your cerebrospinal fluid. This fluid serves as a shock absorber. The bullet travels through your brain faster than the speed at which tissues tear. So the bullet is actually pushing tissues out of the way, stretching them beyond their breaking points. When the tearing finally does happen, the tissues will snap back towards the initial opening and overshoot their original position, going back and forth until they come to a rest. A bullet to the brain is a serious injury, with around a 5% survival rate. In the case of survival, physical damage might be reverted, but a number of other problems would remain. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">For example, if the bullet goes through the:</p>
        <p class="paragraph">-Prefrontal cortex: you lose the ability to process information and solve problems</p>
        <p class="paragraph">-Hippocampus: you lose the ability to index memories</p>
        <p class="paragraph">What happens if you’re shot in the heart?</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Best case - there’s a big hole in the heart. Worst case - the heart would get shredded up.  Blood will pour out of the hole instead of into the aorta. Blood pressure will instantly drop because the pressure in your chest is lower than in your blood vessels. The brain’s vasculature is equipped to cope with pressure changes over a certain range in order to keep actual blood flow constant, but being shot would very likely drop your blood pressure out of that range. This lack of blood to the brainstem will lead to unconsciousness. Getting shot in the heart will very likely lead to instant death. In case the bullet missed the heart and all the major blood vessels, there would be actual odds of survival. A bullet to the chest in general can cause pneumothorax (collapsed lung), hemothorax (accumulation of blood in pleural cavity), tracheobronchial injury, etc.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">What about being shot in your arms, legs or abdomen ?</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Being shot in the arm or leg would likely lead to severe bleeding, fractures, nerve deficits, and soft tissue damage. A bullet to the head or heart would lead to death in most cases, but chances of survival for wounds in these extremities is much higher. This isn’t without its own problems. The victim may have a permanent limp; their arm or leg might have to be cut off; or they may no longer be able to make certain movements. Injury to the abdomen can also lead to severe bleeding, release of bowel contents, organ rupture, peritonitis (inflammation of peritoneum) and neurological deficits. </p>
