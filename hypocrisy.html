        <h2>HYPOCRISY IN THE MINDSETS OF PEOPLE</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">

In today's world, hypocrites can literally be found in every street. There are four forms of hypocrisy that people resort to which are inconsistency, pretence, blame, and complacency. In India the standards of hypocrisy just do not seem to reduce. Some examples for this  are :
</p>

        <p class="paragraph"> - India is the country with 3rd highest porn viewers but talking about sex is a taboo</p>
        <p class="paragraph"> - We have a population of 1.5 billion but are judged for buying condoms</p>
        <p class="paragraph"> - Female deities are worshipped but the same race is killed and tortured</p>
            <p class="paragraph"> - People gawk at steamy pictures of celebrities and yet slut shame them for those pictures</p>
            <p class="paragraph"> - Peeing in public is an acceptable but kissing in public is offensive </p>
            <p class="paragraph"> - A public fight between a couple is a private issue but a friendly conversation between the opposite sexes is a hot topic</p>
            <p class="paragraph"> - Don’t talk to boys before marriage but sleep with a stranger we chose for you </p>
            <p class="paragraph"> - Educating a girl is too expensive but we have sufficient money for her dowry</p>
        <p class="paragraph"> - If it's branded the price doesn't matter but if it's from the street bargain to the lowest price</p>
            <p class="paragraph"> - Being a peon needs educational qualifications but being a politician does not</p>
            <p class="paragraph"> - We love our country on social media but dirty its streets</p>
            <p class="paragraph"> - No one can make a joke on my religion but ridiculing every other religion is okay</p>
            <p class="paragraph"> - Real life martial rape and non-consensual sex is acceptable but consensual intimacy enrages people</p>
            <p class="paragraph"> - Almost every Indian has a personal mobile phone but 60% of the population do not access to toilets</p>
            <p class="paragraph"> - A guy sleeping with multiple girls is a stud but a girl sleeping with two or more guys is a slut</p>
            <p class="paragraph"> - Sportspersons are forgotten but the actors playing them on screen are remembered </p>
            <p class="paragraph"> These are a few double standard statements followed in a lot of households in India. Until and unless we do not change the mentality and people and stop being hypocrites ourselves we cannot hope to have a nation without discrimination . In India gender equality is a myth due to hypocrisy. If people raise a voice against these double standards they are rebels without a cause.
</p>
            <p class="paragraph">This does not prevail only in India but in every part of the world. It is the root cause for a lot of other problems which wouldn’t even exist if people weren’t hypocrites. As lightly as people take it , it is actually a very serious issue. On one hand I do find it comical that people have such mindsets but on the other hand it enrages me that people contradict themselves up to this extent just because they cannot admit their mentality is wrong. Every single one of us is either a victim to this or have supported this unknowingly.
</p>
            <p class="paragraph">So to tackle this issue we need to have an open mind and try to be a little more understanding and less judgemental about everything in our lives. A small change in ourselves can help a greater cause in the world.</p>
