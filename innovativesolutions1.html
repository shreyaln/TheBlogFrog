        <h2>Innovative Solutions To Climate Change</h2>
        <h2>Transportation Part 1- Land transport</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
The vast majority of transportation in our modern society is powered by fossil fuels and we have
long known that this needs to change. The solution proposed by most everyone is going electric.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">This is easier said than done. It is easy to electrify stationary object like household appliances. Since
they are stationary all you need to do is connect it to a wire. But for 'moving' objects it is harder - you can’t
connect them to wires. So rather than continuously providing energy and using it, you need to provide
a lot of energy to a system, store it and then efficiently utilize it over a certain period of time. Cars
that run on fossil fuels achieve this by making room for a gas tank.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">In the case of electric vehicles, the electricity is stored in what is called a battery. But here is the
thing – batteries don’t really come out on top when it comes to efficiently storing energy. A kg of
petroleum contains between 60 and 67 times more power than a kg of a typical lithium-ion battery.
That means we need to allocate more space for traveling shorter distances (and a longer wait to
charge) in order to travel without emitting greenhouse gasses.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">This is possible but it will be less profitable. So, the question is: can we improve on the current
solution to our problem? Yes, we can. Enter Nicola tesla, a brilliant mind of the 21st Century whose
alternating current system is the backbone of our modern electric grid. This was a substantial
achievement but it was one of his lesser dreams. We are going to take inspiration from one of his
greater ideas, the idea in question is the idea of the wireless transportation of electricity.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">To understand how this idea will work we need to understand the production of electricity. The vast
majority of electricity production sums up to: use whatever source of energy you find to somehow
spin a turbine - be it wind, air, sun, nuclear, geothermal or fossil fuels. The specifics of how we get
the turbine spinning does not really matter so let us skip to the part where we make some
electricity. Long story short we use the spin of a turbine to spin magnets to create a strong magnetic
field that forces electrons out of a copper coil and into a wire.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Now the idea is simple: we attach a metal plate to our automobile and we electrically charge the
whole road creating a magnetic field that pushes electrons from our metal plate to our battery. We
electrically charge the road by embedding metal sheets into the roads which are then connected to
the electric grid that provides the power to electrically charge the road.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">So, your car will be continuously charged as you commute. This will all be charged the same way
a debit card is charged. This concept is not just theoretical but it is being tested all across Europe and
it works, allowing for a 50% to 80% decrease in battery size and a 60% to 349% increase in range depending on battery size and vehicle
type.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">And its most major benefit is that it allows for heavy load carrying trucks to go electric without
            significant losses in revenue</p>
