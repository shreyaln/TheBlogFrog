        <h2>Innovative Solutions To Climate Change</h2>
        <h2>Transport Part 1 – Land Transport 2</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
In the last article, we tackled the problem that arises from the low energy density of batteries. In this
article I will be going through solutions to the second third problem with electric
vehicles – charging time and cost (environmental and monetary)</p>

        <p class="paragraph"></p>
        <p class="paragraph">If you own an electric vehicle, you know that it takes a long time to charge your vehicle. What you
may not know is that this is only the tip of the iceberg, the sad truth is that your vehicle, depending
on where you live, is simply not green or not completely green, and your battery is being degraded
faster than necessary because:</p>
        <p class="paragraph"> Problem 1. The electricity used to run your vehicle must be renewable otherwise it is pointless</p>
        <p class="paragraph"> Problem 2. During peak hours, gas plants are used because the wind and solar aren't producing enough to meet demand</p>
        <p class="paragraph"> Problem 3. The faster your vehicle is charged, the faster it will degrade</p>
        <p class="paragraph">The solution to these problems is battery swapping (common in China), which is expensive because
it requires the removal and replacement of a heavy battery which takes up a lot of energy. You can
get around this by making a modular battery. This way we save on time and money.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">You may find yourself asking – how exactly does this solve the above problems? Well the solution to the Problem 1. is
simple, produce renewable energy (I acknowledge that this is not solved by my first solution (Land Transport Part 1)</p>
        <p class="paragraph"> Problems 2. and 3. are solved by:</p>
        <p class="paragraph"> a. Charge during hours with low demand and high renewable output and have pre-charged packs at
hand</p>
        <p class="paragraph">b. Charge slowly to minimize battery degradation</p>
        <p class="paragraph"> Granted this will only work for cars with modular batteries but federal regulation makes that
concern vanish.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">It takes more emissions to make electric vehicles (equivalent to half the emissions that a gas-
powered car will produce in its lifetime). This can be solved by increasing the efficiency of the
manufacturing process and electrifying what you can in it.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">An electric car can cost twice as much as its gas counterpart but, that is only the upfront cost.
Electricity is cheaper than gas, electric cars have fewer moving parts and undergoes less wear and
tear, and most governments offer some kind of subsidy. So, all in all, over its life time an electric
vehicle is significantly cheaper than a gas-powered vehicle.</p>
