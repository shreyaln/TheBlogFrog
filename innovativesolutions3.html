        <h2>Innovative Solutions For Climate Change - Transportation part 1: Land Transport Part 3</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
Before I begin, I would like to note that despite the namesake of this publication this article will not
contain an innovative solution to climate change. Please read on to find out what it does contain.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">In this article, I will be talking about transport diversity and the importance of public transportation.
Today, transportation in the United States is not ideal. It is all based on the car, which is not good. Why
is not good? Well any mode of transport that utilizes as much space and fuel to
transport such a minuscule amount of people per vehicle is both impractical and bad for the
environment. Granted it’s not all bad. It does a good job facilitating ambulance, the police, the fire
department and home delivery . Because it does such a good job at the tasks mentioned
above, it probably won’t disappear any time soon. But making it disappear is not the goal. The
goal is to make up for its short comings when it comes to transporting people. It simply takes much
more energy ⚡ to transport people in cars because you are not only transporting people but also all
the heavy components of a car. Add this to the fact that it takes a lot of cars (especially in cities
where the rate of car ownership is high) for relatively few people (it also takes more space and time
⌚ due to variable speed and traffic signals). Because of all this, many cities in the United States
transport more cars than people per year (mass and volume wise). I don’t need to tell you that
this system of transport is inefficient.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Now the question is - how do we make our transportation system more efficient? Well, we can take
inspiration from the Netherlands. There, 60% of people perform their daily commute by bike. This
way of transportation is more efficient simply because we are transporting more people than metal. But biking isn’t the answer, at least not the whole answer because of disabled
people, old people, people who don’t want to bike and because it is hard to ride the bicycle
far.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">That is where buses, subways, trains and street cars come in.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Street Cars:</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Street Cars are an integral part of any good transportation system. This option also transports more
people than metal. The areas where these would prove useful are on high traffic roads and highways with little room for bicycles. This option would significantly improve public welfare if implemented
properly.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Trains:</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Trains are most useful in inter-city and national scale transport. This option also transports more
people than metal. It can and should (to some extent) replace the highways that currently
provide inter-city and national scale transport.</p>
         <p class="paragraph">Subways:</p>
        <p class="paragraph">The subway is an excellent option for transportation across a metropolitan area because it does
not have the limitations of a street car (speed, travelling on roads). This
option also transports, you guessed it! more people than metal.</p>
                 <p class="paragraph">The Bus:</p>

 <p class="paragraph">The bus is good for transit when in the process of building out the transportation grid for transport
along routes that are not fixed. This option also transports more people than metal. In general,
other transit systems (except car) are better than the bus due to lack of traffic problems, without which
     the bus is the next best option.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">2 Wheeler:</p>
        <p class="paragraph">2 wheelers are better than cars but they are more prone to accidents and even if that is ignored,
public transport such as buses,, subways, trains and street cars are better. But no matter
what, remember to take the most efficient form of transit that took millions of years to master
            whenever you can. In other word’s, walk.</p>
