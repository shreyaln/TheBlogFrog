        <h2>Innovative Solutions For Climate Change - Transportation part 1: Land Transport Part 4</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
Imagine you are hired by a city government to address a traffic congestion problem in the city. You
must do so in a cost-efficient way. The city has a decent public transport system and many highly
congested roads. What do you do? You would probably add lanes to the roads because it is a
one-time expense, but this never works. The reason why this doesn’t work is simple - the people who
previously took different modes of transportation, like the decent public transport, will now use their
cars because a spacious road is much better than any old bus. This results in – best case scenario –
no change in traffic levels, after more people hit the road or – worst case scenario – the
traffic gets worse than it was before. The worst thing about this is you get to pat your self on the
back because in your mind you think more people were going to start driving anyway and the
situation would have been worse if you didn’t expand the roads.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">To find the right answer, we need to take a step back and talk about transit systems as a whole.
Transit systems in most cities are treated as welfare programs. All but one transit system in the
world is unprofitable. To make it profitable you need to raise prices, but if you raise prices people
will stop using that mode of transit which means you will have to raise prices even more which will make more
people turn to alternative forms of transport which means you will have to raise prices again and
until only the richest of people use public transit as a status symbol. Oof that was a long sentence. Since this means down
sizing your ridership, you will no longer have a public transport and your profit shall be small.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Let us talk about that one transit system that is profitable. The Hong Kong MTR. This transit system is
profitable for 4 main reasons.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">1) 90% of all Hong Kong residents utilize this system of transit. An interesting fact is that there are 92
cars for every 1000 people in Hong Kong and 800 for every 1000 in the United States.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">2)Hong Kong residents already have noticeably high GDP/capita. (Achieved by smart policy and
welfare)</p>
        <p class="paragraph">3)The Hong Kong transit system is relatively new (the London underground system was created in the 1870s,
the New York subway was created in 1904)</p>
        <p class="paragraph">4)Property leases: the property in and around a train station is leased at high rates which are
accepted because it provides access to 90% of the population.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">In short, you need a new highly used transit system for relatively rich people in order to make your transit
system profitable. Developing such a system is the answer.</p>
