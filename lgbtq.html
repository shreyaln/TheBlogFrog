        <h2>Brief History of the LGBTQ Initialism</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
Prior to the late-nineteenth century, there was no concept of having a distinct sexual identity, however people in the past lived lives that are akin to our present sense of what it means to be LGBTQ. Gay identity did not completely emerge as a personal and political term until the mid-twentieth century. Historically, words used to describe sexuality and gender lacked specificity. The term "homosexual," coined in 1869, was not  widely used until the early twentieth century. In the mid-twentieth century, homosexual activists favoured the term "homophile" over homosexual, perceiving it as a more neutral and acceptable option because it removed the adjective "sexual" while acknowledging same-gender desire. "Gay" began as an underground term in the early twentieth century and gained widespread acceptance in the 1960s. The phrase was chosen by the Stonewall generation, who, unlike their predecessors, were less likely to regard homosexuality as a stigma or a mental disorder. Though currently the term "gay" primarily refers to men who are attracted to males, it was historically used as a broad phrase that embraced the entire current LGBTQ initialism. </p>

        <p class="paragraph">The term "lesbian" is derived from the Greek island of Lesbos, which is linked with the poet Sappho, whose surviving works beautifully express passionate love and attraction between women. Nonetheless, until the 1990s, the term "gay" was frequently used as a colloquial term to refer to the entire spectrum of sexual and gender minorities. With the advent of bisexual, transgender, and queer groups, this usage altered, giving rise to the four-letter LGBT initialism, which was considered as more inclusive than merely referring to the community as “gay.”
Activists promoted the word "transgender" to form a coalition of people who did not fit neatly into gender binaries or who defied gender norms and expectations. “transgender” was also used by those who did not identify with the older name “transsexual” due to its association with medical transition across the gender binary.
</p>
        <p class="paragraph">The letter "Q" was sometimes added to the initialism to allude to "queer" people or those who were "questioning" their sexual orientation or gender identity. The term "queer" can also refer to a reclaimed identity, an identity that represents a more radical, militant, or confrontational attitude to identity politics, or an umbrella term that includes anybody or anything outside of gender and sexuality norms.
Since the 1990s, other versions of the initialism have emerged as more nuanced approaches to understanding and defining people's lived experiences of gender and sexuality have been expressed. LGBTQQIP2SAA is an abbreviated version of the initialism that stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning, intersex, pansexual, two spirit, asexual, and ally.
