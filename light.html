        <h2>THE NIGHTS ARE DISAPPEARING INTO THE LIGHT</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
Undeniably, the light bulb is by far one of the greatest inventions in history. With just a flick of a switch, we push away darkness. But the use of light bulbs comes with a price. The excess light we dump into the environment is endangering ecosystems by harming animals whose life cycles depend on the dark. We are also endangering ourselves by altering the biochemical rhythms that normally flow with natural light levels. The night sky is disappearing into the light.
</p>

        <p class="paragraph">In school, we learn about air, water, land and noise pollution. But there is another type of pollution which is less commonly acknowledged: Light Pollution. It is the presence of anthropogenic and excess artificial light in the night environment. Have you ever heard an older person say that there used to be more stars in the sky? Well now the sky is filled with so much artificial light that 99.5% of all stars that people can see are completely invisible without optical aid.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Over the years, we have aimed mainly to reduce the energy consumption and cost of lighting. Due to this, LEDs have gained popularity. Although they are cheaper and consume less energy, white LEDs emit wavelengths of blue light that bounce around in the atmosphere, potentially increasing sky glow. These wavelengths are also known to affect animals and humans more dramatically than light from other parts of the spectrum.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Light pollution has put our biological cycles out of sync. Rhythmic shifting between day and night rules our physiology - helps us sleep at night and wake up in the morning. So there is a connection between light and biology. Photons strike our retinas, triggering signals that reach a knot of neurons known as the suprachiasmatic nucleus. This knot is a crucial regulator of the brainâ€™s pineal gland, which produces the hormone melatonin. Melatonin begins rising around sundown and peaks at midnight, unleashing reactions that regulate sleep-wake cycles, lower body temperature, slow metabolism and increase leptin (hormone which reduces appetite).
At a single glance this may not seem very important, but there are dire consequences of light pollution interrupting our circadian rhythms (regulate sleep-wake cycles and repeats roughly every 24 hours). This interruption causes low levels of leptin which can lead to obesity, heart-disease, diabetes, depression and cancer. Therefore it is crucial that we take steps towards reducing light pollution. We could start by using low-temperature LEDs, compact fluorescents, and turning off unnecessary outdoor lighting.</p>
