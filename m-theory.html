        <h2>M-Theory and the Concept of Time</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
One of the most sought-after conjectures in modern physics is a combined theory that flawlessly
describes every phenomenon in the universe to an adequate degree of accuracy. While we have
theories like quantum mechanics and relativity that are able to explain both the very small and very
large; they are contradictory. Combining the two theories however could be just what physicists
need in order to develop an effective theory of everything. While the M-theory or membrane theory
is currently our best guess, its two-time module suggests that there could, alongside 11 dimensions
of space, exist two time dimensions, one real and one imaginary, resulting in a combined total of 13
dimensions as opposed to the three spatial ones we are familiar with and encounter in our daily
lives.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">The two-time theory as proposed by Itzhak Bars from the University of Southern California, states
that time, instead of being linear, is a two-dimensional plane interwoven within the eleven spatial
dimensions. Though this idea may seem counterintuitive, these dimensions are infinitesimally small
and hence we cannot perceive them. A well rounded correlation to this idea is the ant on a wire
analogy that goes something like this:</p>
        <p class="paragraph">if a distant observer was to view an ant moving helically on a wire, it would seem as though it is
moving along a straight line in one dimension. This is because the observer perceives the wire to be
a one-dimensional line having only length and the ant can therefore move only forward or
backward. The ant however being smaller is theoretically able to scout all three dimensions of the
wire i.e., its length, width, and height. (the height in practice however would only be accessible to
the ant at the edges of the wire, considering they hang free.)</p>
        <p class="paragraph">As aforementioned, the two-dimensional time plane consists of two axes, one depicting real and the
other, imaginary time. Real time is what we already know as linear time consisting of a past, present
and future. It is extremely useful in describing motion as motion is usually described as a function of
time i.e., 10 km/hr, 5m/s etc. It is not absolute as was believed prior to the publication and
acceptance of Einstein’s theory of relativity but varies depending on the relative speed and position
of an observer. Imaginary time however is a mathematical representation of time having undergone
a wick rotation, having its coordinates being multiplied by the square root of negative 1 or the
imaginary number ‘i’. Similar to the algebraic concept in which when a real number is multiplied by
an imaginary one, the real number becomes imaginary, the coordinates of real time (T) when
multiplied by i, become imaginary (Ti). This imaginary time axis mathematically is parallel to the real
time axis, thus creating a two-dimensional plane consisting of an x and y axis.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">While widely considered a theoretical concept, one of the many implications of imaginary time is
that it could help smooth out gravitational singularities, areas where all known laws of physics break
down. As a consequence of the unravelling of singularities, imaginary time could go on to prove
Stephen Hawking’s no boundary condition that states that the universe has no boundary as a
boundary in spacetime is simply a singularity, similar to the one that makes an appearance in the
infamous big bang theory. The unproven relationship between imaginary time and its manifestations
in real time has raised criticisms to the likes of physicists like Roger Penrose. If a tangible relationship
is found however, it could enable us to gain insight into the question of ‘what’s before the big bang?’
since time as we know it i.e., real time did not exist. Imaginary time also opens up the possibility of
time travel as it forms a plane that when inwoven can loop back over itself.</p>
