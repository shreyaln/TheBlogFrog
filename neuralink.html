        <h2>NEURALINK-THE MYSTICAL FUTURE OF THE MIND</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
Rock-climb without fear. Play a symphony in your head. See radar with superhuman vision. Discover the nature of consciousness. Cure blindness, paralysis, deafness, and mental illness. Those are just a few of the applications that Elon Musk and employees, at his four-year-old neuroscience company Neuralink, believe electronic brain-computer interfaces will one day bring about. </p>

        <p class="paragraph">The initial aim of this technology would be to assist people with paralysis in regaining independence through computer and mobile device control. The devices are intended to help people interact more easily through text or speech synthesis, to pursue their interests on the web, or to express their imagination through photography, art, or writing apps.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">The brain contains 86 billion neurons. Neurons communicate by sending and receiving information. While neurons come in a variety of shapes and sizes, they all have three parts in common: a dendrite that receives a signal, a cell body called a soma that computes the signal, and an axon that sends the signal out. The brain's neurons communicate with one another through axon-dendrite connections known as synapses to send and receive signals. Synapses release neurotransmitters as a result of action potentials. These small molecules bind to receptors on dendrites, allowing current to flow across the neuron's membrane. To detect action potentials, Neuralink positions electrodes near neurons. It  can decode the information represented by neurons by recording from a significant number of them. Neurons, for example, represent intended actions in movement-related areas of the brain. Neurons in the brain transmit data about everything we see, feel, touch, or think. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
Neuralink is working on the first neural implant that will enable you to operate a computer or mobile device from anywhere. Threads of micron size are inserted into regions of the brain that regulate movement. Each thread contains a number of electrodes and connects them to an implant, the Link. The threads on the Link are so fine and flexible that they cannot be inserted by hand. Instead, the team is developing a robotic device that the neurosurgeon can use to insert these threads precisely where they are needed. The Neuralink app allows you to control your iOS device, keyboard, and mouse directly through your brain activity, simply by thinking about it.
</p>
        <p class="paragraph">The Link is a prototype for a new type of brain interface. As technology advances, we will be able to access more channels of communication with the brain, allowing us to access more brain regions and new types of neural information. This technology has the ability to treat a wide variety of neurological disorders, regain sensory and movement function, and, ultimately, expand how we communicate with each other, with the world, and with ourselves.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Elon Musk's brain-chip startup released footage that displays a monkey playing a basic videogame after receiving implants of the latest technology. Pager, a male macaque with chips implanted on either side of its brain, plays 'Mind Pong' in a 3-minute video by Neuralink. He was taught to turn a joystick, but it is now unplugged. He moves the paddle simply by thinking of moving his hand up and down.</p>
