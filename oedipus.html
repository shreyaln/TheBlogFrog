        <h2>OEDIPUS COMPLEX</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
The Oedipal complex, also known as the Oedipus complex, is a phrase coined by Sigmund Freud to describe a child's feelings of desire for his or her opposite-sex parent and jealously and hatred at his or her same-sex parent in his psychosexual stages of development hypothesis. In essence, a boy believes he is fighting with his father for his mother's affections, whereas a girl believes she is fighting with her mother for her father's affections. Children see their same-sex parent as a competitor for the attention and affections of their opposite-sex parent, according to Freud.
Oedipus, according to a Greek myth, is abandoned at infancy and hence has no idea who his parents are. He discovers their true identities only after he has killed his father and married his mother.
</p>

        <p class="paragraph">The Oedipus complex refers to a child's desire for sexual interaction with the opposite sex parent, particularly a boy's romantic attraction to his mother, according to psychoanalytic theory. Although repression keeps this desire hidden from conscious awareness, Freud believed it nonetheless influenced a child's behavior and had a part in growth. The Oedipus complex, according to Freud, was significant in the phallic stage of psychosexual development. He also believed that completing this stage required identifying with the same-sex parent, which would lead to the development of a mature sexual identity. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">According to Freud, the boy wants to possess his mother and replace his father, whom he sees as a competitor for her love. The child develops a sexual desire to his or her opposite-sex parent and animosity toward the same-sex parent throughout this period of development.  A youngster exhibiting possessiveness of his mother and instructing his father not to touch or kiss his mother are examples of behavioural expressions of the complex. At this age, little girls may proclaim that when they grow up, they want to marry their dad.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Oedipus complex is one of the most debated and contested topics in psychology. Experts have varied perspectives and opinions on the complex, including whether or not it exists and to what extent it does.
