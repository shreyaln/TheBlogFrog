        <h2>Life With Parkinson’s Disease</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
What is Parkinson’s Disease? It a disorder of the central nervous system that affects movement, often including tremors caused by the gradual decline in function of a part of the brain called the substantia Niagra. Although it is a disease that can occur at any age, the elderly is more prone to this ‘progressive’ disease. India alone has 1 million cases every year. Parkinson’s disease is accompanied by tremors, stiffness, difficulty with walking, balance and coordination. An individual suffering from the disease is also impacted mentally by increase in depression, anxiety and insomnia.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Parkinson’s disease does not have any peculiar symptoms except recurring tremors that gradually increase, with some not even noticeable. So how is a person diagnosed with Parkinson's? Diagnosing Parkinson’s disease isn't easy for the doctor or the patient. Scanning the head using a CT scan or MRI does help with finding other causes for symptoms but cannot determine the presence of the disease. Same goes for the cure, there is no specific cure. However, it can be treated by taking medicines to increase dopamine levels, antidepressants to cope with the disease, anti-tremor medications etc. A person diagnosed with Parkinsons disease would unfortunately have to continue to live with it, a task most people give up on once the tremors subsequently start to increase.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">As stated earlier, these patients are likely to suffer from depression and anxiety, a time where support from their loved ones is very crucial. Several charities are dedicated towards developing better care and quality of life for them. Multiple websites are also coming up by numerous foundations to motivate these patients to discuss what they are going through and to make them realize that they are not alone. At the end of the day, they too should be able to live a normal and regular life like anybody else.</p>
