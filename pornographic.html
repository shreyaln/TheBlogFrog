        <h2>PORNOGRAPHIC ADDICTION</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
Sexual preferences differ from person to person. However, with today's pornography epidemic  one has to worry how this will affect our desires, sexuality perception and sex lives. Pornography accounts for around 25% of all search engine results, and is the fourth most prevalent purpose for going on the internet. It may appear to be nothing more than a means of facilitating an innate sexual reaction related to millions of years of evolution. The truth is that pornography has evolved dramatically over time, ultimately shaping our tastes and desires. The not-so-surprising reality is that pornography has profound effects on the brain and behaves in many ways like a drug. With repeated exposure, your tolerance increases, and many people become hooked. Though it is not a physical substance, it causes the same general loss of control, compulsive seeking of the action despite negative consequences, and withdrawal when it is discontinued, much like the case of gambling and drinking. </p>

        <p class="paragraph">The problem is that repeated exposure can result in long-term or even lifetime neuroplastic changes in the brain. Dopamine is released as a reward anytime we complete a task, whether it is eating to support life or sexual activity to create future life. This dopamine strengthens neuronal connections in order to motivate us to repeat the same activity in the future. In other words, it changes and shapes brain cells to motivate specific behaviours.
It changes the way your brain works. Rats were used by the national institutes of health to assess drug addiction. The rat is taught to press a button in order to obtain a drug, and the harder it works, indicates how addictive the substance is. It turns out that the more the addictiveness of a drug, the more dopamine is released. Although there is no rat porn available for them, we do know that dopamine is released during sexual arousal, which pornography plays directly into. The more time you spend doing it, the more dopamine is released, reinforcing the habit and making you not only desire but also require it in the future. It is a feedback loop that gets more difficult to break, and your tolerance for visual stimulation has now increased, making it more difficult to be turned on by reality. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">Pornography addiction can frequently lead to finding your mate less attractive; nevertheless, this does not have to be permanent. Usually, when people comprehend the mechanism and realize how it affects their relationships, they seek help.
The brain is frequently described as a "use it or lose it" system because neuronal connections that are stimulated get stronger and demand to be engaged, but those that are ignored, deteriorate. Much like your muscles, which ache for exercise after sitting inert all day but grow complacent after a period of inactivity. Fortunately, because of the "use it or lose it" brain, the same neuro-plastic system that promotes harmful behaviours may also be used to develop better ones.
