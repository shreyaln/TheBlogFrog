        <h2>THE PULLEY</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
Pulleys are older than Archimedes himself, but until he arrived nobody really knew how to use
them in a clever way. Most pulleys back then were used without other pulleys
connected to it, like in wells. It is by putting many together that we get a mechanical
advantage.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Mechanical advantage:</p>
        <p class="paragraph">In simple words, mechanical advantage is achieved when the material properties of a substance are
taken advantage of to produce a desirable output.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Now in the case of pulleys, the desirable output is being able to lift stuff easily.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">The mechanical property that we take advantage of is the tension of the rope in a pulley and the
sturdiness of whatever the pulley is attached to.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Explanation 1:</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Most explanations of this simply state that your trading force for distance which is
true but it does not capture the whole picture.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Explanation 2:</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Explanation 1 + the tension in the ropes is responsible for the increase in force. The
idea being that as the rope is pulled, its bonds pull back (both microscopic bonds between atoms and
molecules and the macroscopic bonds like the twist of threads that compose a rope), this pull supposedly
makes it possible to lift any load with less force because the rope itself exerts force. This is true but it’s not
that simple.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Imagine you are carrying a bag and someone picks you up (with their hands) then due to the
transitive property of picking things up, the person who picked you up also picked up the bag. We all
know that you were holding the bag up therefore it must have felt like just picking you up and not
picking up the bag, right? Wrong. Just because you were picking it up doesn't mean its mass
disappeared. That would be like saying you put all your stuff in a container that is as heavy as a paper
bag and when you lifted it, it was as easy as lifting up the paper bag without all your stuff in it.
So, the tension in the ropes is not the key to the desirable output.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Explanation 3:</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Every pulley ever used has one thing in common, it
has a support (the rod that keeps it in place). It uses the sturdiness of the support to help lift
the load. Many pulleys manage to lift with even less force because the force is provided by
the support (which is ultimately connected to the ground and the point at which
the support meets the ground, the ground gets compressed and pushes back (this push back
,like the pushback from a compressed spring, is what allows the mechanism to lift something with less
force).</p>

        <p class="paragraph">AND THAT’S HOW A CRANE MANAGES TO LIFT VERY HEAVY THINGS WITH MUCH LESS FORCE</p>
