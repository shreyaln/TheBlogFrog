        <h2>Model for Relationship Change</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
Mark Knapp established a descriptive model in 1978 that explained how relationships grow and dissolve. Since it is based on the many levels of self-disclosure and communication that characterise the closeness (or lack thereof) of a relationship, the model arose from social penetration theory.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">The concept is roughly based on a stairwell model, with ten phases divided into two interconnected processes.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">1.	relationship escalation</p>
        <p class="paragraph">2.	relationship termination.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">In this way, the model aids in the understanding of how a close relationship grows and deteriorates. Although the model comprises ten stages, a relationship does not have to go through all of them, and the stages do not have a timeline: Some relationships develop swiftly through the paradigm, while others take their time, and some relationships may skip some of the stages altogether.</p>
        <img src="img/relationship1.png" alt="">
        <p class="paragraph">Knapp's model for the stages of relationship development and termination.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">The first five steps of the model theorise that relationship escalation leads to increasing levels of commitment within an interpersonal relationship</p>
        <p class="paragraph">1.	Initiating: this brief step is all about establishing a good first impression. As a result, early judgments are often inaccurate. The emphasis is on establishing positive first impressions, and physical appearance plays a significant role in this process.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">2.	Experimenting: At this point, it's all about getting to know one another. This stage usually consists of small talk and the search for common ground or interests so that the individuals involved can determine whether or not to continue dating. Because of a lack of common interests, the majority of relationships end up here.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">3.	Intensifying: As the connection progresses, it becomes more intense and less formal. Self-disclosure occurs when personal information is exchanged and revelations are made, particularly concerning sentiments about a relationship. Giving gifts, spending more time together, and asking for dates help to foster the relationship and enhance interpersonal development. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">4.	Integrating: At this stage, efforts are made to bring the partnership closer together than it has ever been. Before making arrangements, partners think about each other, and the term "we" becomes increasingly common. Those who are not involved in the relationship become more aware of it.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">5.	Bonding: This stage is frequently marked by public declarations of the relationship. Commitments, such as engagements, marriages, or friendship rituals, are also part of this stage.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">The last five steps of the model describe the stages of relationship termination</p>
        <p class="paragraph">1.	Differentiating: At this point in the relationship, individuals begin to think about themselves rather than with their partner. As differences become more apparent, partners seek independence. Partners frequently express their dissatisfaction with their commitment.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">2.	Circumscribing: at this stage, couples tend to avoid uncomfortable issues, and their interactions grow more limited as additional communication boundaries are established. Fearing a debate, many people avoid discussing challenging topics. They will have their own activities and personal space.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">3.	Stagnating: If the relationship reaches the level of stagnation, it will continue to deteriorate. Communication is becoming increasingly constrained. Due to circumstances beyond their control (such as children, relatives, or friends) or other inescapable causes, couples frequently opt not to separate, sometimes even to prevent the emotional suffering that can precede separation. Relationships at this stage are defined as stagnant since they do not continue or improve.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">4.	Avoiding: At this point, the partners are consciously avoiding contact with one another, and they are often physically separated. They shun all forms of communication with one another in order to avoid having to talk or argue with one another.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">5.	Terminating: This is the final step of a dissolving relationship, and ultimately leads to the end of the relationship. The partners decide to go on separate paths. This is not always a subjective decision (like a divorce), but it might happen spontaneously when folks who lived next door move out, or when roommates change as the year progresses, or when high-school friends go off to different colleges.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">It's vital to highlight that the model's focus is on how relationships evolve rather than why they change, as it covers a relationship's escalation and termination stages. According to Knapp's model, the function of communication in relationships, particularly in terms of social penetration theory and self-disclosure, is central to why relationships change. Finally, keep in mind that the steps in the model are generalisations that may or may not apply to all couples or cultures. </p>
